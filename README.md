#2D Water Demo

A simple demonstration of 2d water used in scrolling-based game made by Flash and AS3.0. I don't familiar with AS3.0 much, so I think my AS code is poor.

I read this [post](http://gamedev.tutsplus.com/tutorials/implementation/make-a-splash-with-2d-water-effects/) to complete this demo, however the writer use XNA.
